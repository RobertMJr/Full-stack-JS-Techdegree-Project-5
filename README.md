# Full-Stack-JS-Techdegree-Project-5
 My Fifth Techdegree Project

 This is an app for a fictional company named Awesome Startup that has remote employees working all over the world.  
 Used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.  
 It works by requesting a JSON object from the API then parsing it and listing 12 employees in a gird with their thumbnail image, full name, email and location.  
 Clicking on an employee's name or image opens a modal window with more detailed information - employee's birthday, address...etc
